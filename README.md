**Annotation of me**: "This will be a the long way to learn blender. Starting 2019 with the little blender particle system tutorial, I needed three years to decide learning Blender complete. For this purpose I bought in a super offers period some courses from Udemy. Simple criterion was that the courses are suitable for beginners. If I hold out my goal, I will rate all this courses."
